Front End React

Build two component : one for the header / and other main content

Component H1 Header
Title, Logo

Main content First Page
Clickable unstyled button (to begin with ) Fetch request to the topic
Build a Component for each topic.
After each 'click' another question will appear with the button
The question will tell you are right or wrong. Question will only change when you click again for the next question.
Each question will be a state and will re-load everytime

Questions:
The questions will be looped within an array.
We will have a counter that track the points of the correct answers.
On the last question the button will change to results.
Include another button that can say 'play again'

Back-End

To use Express for creating a Node Project
Create the tables in SQL - Player 1 only to start, then could have 2 players, groups playing.
Id, Question, Right answer, wrong answer.
We will have multiple tables,one for each topic & populate.

Handle Request (route) GET, POST , Request, Response

The fetch request goes to a route.

Need a model to handle the request of the data.
